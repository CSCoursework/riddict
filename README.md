# riddict
A word game where you have to guess a word based off of the dictionary definition.
Just remember when playing, this game is really hard at first and because of the api, you have to use american spelling or the answer will be wrong, although maybe I will change that soon.

## Installation

### Windows
Go to https://github.com/boogalewie/riddict/releases/ and click on riddict.zip for the latest release.
Click into the zip and double click riddict.exe.

## Usage

Click play then enter in the anwer line what you think the answer is.
You can get combos and get lost lives back. A combo of 10 gives a life back,
however, there is a time limit.
